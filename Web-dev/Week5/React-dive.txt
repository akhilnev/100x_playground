https://shorturl.at/cjvMU -> 5.1 notes 

1. Foundational React Class notes and Jargon in 5.1 
2. Dont need React for static websites at all! -> HTML Not changing 
3. We need Reat for DOM Manipulation ( Week 4) -> to make it easier rather than coding alot to do the same! 

Why React?
-> Very tough to write DOM Manipulation code in HTML/CSS/JS plain -> thus we make React making it easy 
-> Facebook making a huge website -> made React to simplify stuff -> made OpenSource 

STATE AND COMPONENTS -> 2 MAIN THINGS IN REACT ( ALL FRONT END FRAMEWORKS ARE BASED ON THIS! )

State -> JS object representing dynamic things in the app ( ONLY DYNAMIC )

1 State can have multiple components -> HTML Snippet showing current State values ( Linkedin Top - Bar )

Re-rendering -> When a component in a state changes -> re-rendering occurs when backend changes component value!

We need to:

1. Define State of application 

2. Update State of application or components inside the state 

3. React takes care of the re-rendering part ( no need to write DOM logic for the same! )

Example making a state and component for count button with increasing value: ( SHIFTING TO REACT FROM DOM! )

State :
{
    count : 0 
}

Component:

function buttonComponent(count){
    return (
    <div>
        // button with onclick function increasing count in the state! 
    </div>
    )
}

Array Destructuring: ( In JS for React Syntax )

let arr = [1,2]

const [a,b] = arr // pattern macthed or array Destructuring!

npm run build -> converts react code to HTML/CSS/JS of our current app and we can just host that if we need and dont need our React multiple folders yet!
