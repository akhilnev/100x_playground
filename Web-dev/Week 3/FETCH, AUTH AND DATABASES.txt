FETCH, AUTH AND DATABASES(Mongo - DB) !!
- Building a simple end to end project (Backend and Database project!)

1. FETCH API

- Website helps us get Data from backend dynamically 
- Create a simple HTML/ Front end code -> hitting backend data and retrieving names!
- ( How to do the thing above ? )
    - Button + API getting hit method or code how to write ?
    - Made with comments in ./frontend.html
    - We havent put data on the screen yet -> related to DOM 
        - We will next see how to put data and without button put data say on every reload -> using DOM

2. AUTHENTICATION (STARTED WITH LAST NOTES)

- Creating a dummy website where people can sign in and see data only if signed in!!
- Woerking with how do we do Authenication in the same ?
- Complicated way -> using external API calls say google , okta , etc
- We will be doing basic Authenication on our own!!

- Cryptography Jargon: ( basic concept explanations! )
    - JSON Webtokens (most imp to understand):
        - Some hashing function taking in only JSONS -> Significatly diff from Hashing asnd Encryption
        - Takes JSON input and gives out very long string called Token 
        - Anyone with Token can login/look at contents ( can use GPT + jwt.io to see how to works)
            - GPT uses JWT's to conevert
        - Complex JSON -> (JWT.encode function + Password given) -> Token given out -> Token + Password(by dev/ head,not user) (verification done ( JWT.verify)) -> give out data 
        - Not token can decoded by anyone, but we need the Passsord with developing compant to verify and give out data we need, thus even if someone decodes he wont get access to your data!!
    - Others:
        1. Hashing: Passwords hashed before storing, Single input to HF -> same function , for database breach cant see password exactly, can never guess or decrpyt back to passowrd
            - How to validate actual password -> actual password re-coneverted to the gibberish -> This is how to works
        2. Encryption: Hashing + back conversion allowed only if we have key access!
            - Anyone with key can decrypt the the encrypted password

- When we sign in a JWT Toke is sent to your local storage thus if we close tab and open again -> we dont need to resigin in the local storage token is used!!
- Real world authenication example ^^
- jwt.sign({<what we need to encrypt>,jwtPassword})
- const decoded = jwt.verify(token,password) -> (and then use) ->  decoded.username == username 


Assignment: ( Creating simple Authenication Based  application !)
- 2 Endpoints: 
    1.POST /sign -in and return JSON with only username ( returns username encrypted token, to not expose any password)
    2. GET, /users with Headers- Authheader to get list of usernames from backend DB if signed in/ token sent is right!!
        - Else 403 error should be sent ( Access not allowed )


3. DATABSES: ( MONGO DB BASICS )
- Backend server works with the database, using credentials of Each of them
- User hits backend, backend hits database and thats how they communicate
- Multiple kind of DB's
    - Vector DB: AI/ML
    - Graph DB: Very specific use
    - NoSQL: Newer web used -> MONGODB ( CREATE DB, TABLES, CLOUD MAINTAINED)
    - SQL: Most full stack

MONGO DB AND NOSQL:
- Can create DB'S , Scales well 
- Schemaless! -> dont need to define the database schema ( units ) -> very strict in SQL like DB 
- Mongo DB instance and connection URL ( Similar to COMS 363 )

NOTE:
- We use Express to make HTTP Servers
- jasonwebtokens helps us create JWT'S 
- Mongoose library helps us connect Backend to Database 

CONNECTING BACKEND TO DB : ( PROCESS )
- We USE Mongoose Library to connect the backend database

General Template for Mongoose connection and writing to MongoDB:

            const mongoose = require("mongoose") // Along with npm install mongoose

            mongoose.connect(<unique MONOGODB URL>)

            const User = mongoose.model('Users',{name:String, email:String, ..}) // etc

            const user = new User(....)

            user.save(); // saves user in User DB
