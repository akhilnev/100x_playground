Middlewears, auth, global caches, zod

- Before user actually hits backend 2 checks gen happen "auth check" and "input validation" check
- Coding a Hospital with constrainsts and checks!
- // AUTH CHECK - USE Middlewears LOGIC WRITTEN IN THE CODE BEFORE 
- // USERS CAN SEND RANDOM SHIT TO BREAK BACKEND AND TRY TO BREAK THE BACKEND BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE REGULATED - MANUAL INDUVIDUAL EDGE CASE HANDLONG OR ZOD LIBRARY FOR INPUT CHECKS CAN BE USED !!
    - to THIS use something called a global cache!! -> we write = app.use(function(err,req,res,next){res.json({msg:"Sorry something is up"})}) // always gets hit if an error occurs in any API endpoint we made!!

- INPUT VALIDATION:
    - HOW CAN WE USE ZOD TO DO INPUT VALIDATION ??
