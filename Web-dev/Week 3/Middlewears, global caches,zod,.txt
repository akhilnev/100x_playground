Middlewears, global caches,zod, Authentication

- Before user actually hits backend 2 checks gen happen "auth check" and "input validation" check
- Coding a Hospital with constrainsts and checks!


- // AUTH CHECK - USE Middlewears LOGIC WRITTEN IN THE CODE BEFORE 
- // USERS CAN SEND RANDOM SHIT TO BREAK BACKEND AND TRY TO BREAK THE BACKEND BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE REGULATED - MANUAL INDUVIDUAL EDGE CASE HANDLONG OR ZOD LIBRARY FOR INPUT CHECKS CAN BE USED !!
    - to THIS use something called a global cache!! -> we write = app.use(function(err,req,res,next){res.json({msg:"Sorry something is up"})}) // always gets hit if an error occurs in any API endpoint we made!!

- INPUT VALIDATION:
    - HOW CAN WE USE ZOD TO DO INPUT VALIDATION ??  ( LOOK AT SAMPLE CODE IN THE JS FILE!!)

- AUTHENICATION:
 - Till now in codebase we have been sending username and passwords in headers or body of the req - DUMB WAY
 - Slightly better way :
    - Using authorization we send Email and Password to server while loggin in, it sends back a unique token it generates  everytime the server is connected or logged on to it, 
    - We use tokens as it would be too public to expose username with password in every request! -> This would be extremely dangerous 
    - Avg Process : Username and password sent to backend server, backend checks with DB and sends back a JWT if correct
        -> Once JWT is sent it is stored on the front end -> Till we log out front end sends JWT to backend without resending username, password and backedn uses JWT (token) to validate 
    - Thus we learn how to add tokens or authorization to out API endpoints next !
