-> Foundation in React class ( DSA heavy and 4.2 notes using ) 
-> Slides at: https://shorturl.at/iCLO6

DOM Manipulation -> Adding HTML inside page through JS ! ( Using DOM ) -> very tough 
-> Now React VUE makes it easier to do it! 
-> making a complex DOM application and seeing how hard it is to make dynamic websites!

-> simple appending will not work in an actual Full-stack app as we cannot support a mobile + web app which has constant changes on both the ends 

NEXT TASK:
-> P2 : Take a state from backend and render it on the web app and vice versa update state as we change on the web - app

UPDATED CODE BASED : https://shorturl.at/yFTX1

-> Note in react while getting the new state rendered (difference is calculated!! ) -> not full thing replaced
-> Assignment implements the same!!
